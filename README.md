INFORMATION
This small addon adds 60Rnd STANAG for RHSUSAF in three variants according to their ammo type: M855A1, Mk262 Mod 0 and Mk318 Mod 0.
Magazine weight: 0.91kg (2.00lb).
Should work with all compatible CBA magwells.
BIKEY and BISIGN included

Proper magazine model is not yet included, it will look the same as the 30rnd STANAG. Magazine truly has 60 rounds. I may add proper model in the future, but until then if someone would like to contribute, they can do so using the
GitHub[github.com].
