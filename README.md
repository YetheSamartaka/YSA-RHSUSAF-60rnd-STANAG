## INFORMATION
- This small addon adds 60Rnd STANAG for RHSUSAF in three variants according to their ammo type: M855A1, Mk262 Mod 0 and Mk318 Mod 0
- Magazine weight: 0.91kg (2.00lb)
- Should work with all compatible CBA magwells
- BIKEY and BISIGN included

Proper magazine model is not yet included, it will look the same as the 30rnd STANAG. Magazine truly has 60 rounds. I may add proper model in the future, but until then if someone would like to contribute, they can do so using this GitHub Repository.
